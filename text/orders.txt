To General Lucius Valerius,

By decree of Emperor Hadrian, you are hereby ordered to march your legion north
to Britannia. Make haste to reinforce the garrison at Eboracum. The Picts grow
bold and threaten our northern borders. You are to arrive before the autumn
equinox.

Gather provisions for a three-month campaign. Requisition additional cavalry
from the Batavian auxiliaries. Upon arrival, coordinate with Governor Quintus
Lollius Urbicus to quell the barbarian insurgency.

The glory of Rome rests upon your swift action.

Signed,
Marcus Aurelius Severus,
Imperial Legate
